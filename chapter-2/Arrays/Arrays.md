# Javascript Arrays

## Introduction

Arrays in Javascript are used to create a list of items. Arrays can hold: 
* Strings
* Numbers
* Objects
* Functions
* Arrays

Arrays have different methods that allow you to manipulate the items in an array. some methods
you will come across will : 
* Add items
* Remove items
* Tell you where items are in an array
* Find where an item is in an array
* add 2 Arrays together

## Tasks
1. Read through different Array methods in "arrays.js" 
2. Once you get an understanding of Arrays, Complete the excercises in "Excercise.js"
3. Test your answers using the **ArraySpecRunner.html** in **ExcerciseTests**

# Excercise Rules

* Dont remove any variables in the file
* only add methods to the variables
* Don't cheat by just adding a new array to variable with the answer. 

# Excercise Tips

You may see a function like this : 

 ```javascript
    function GetArrayIndex(item){
        return array
    }
```
A clue for this excercise is you just need to add a method to the array variable, 
which takes in the variable `item`, you dont need to change the structure of the function.
