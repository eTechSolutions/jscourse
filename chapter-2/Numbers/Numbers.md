in JavaScript all numbers are implemented in double percision 64-bit binary format(number between -(2^53-1) and 2^53-1).
There is no specific type for integers.

and use `Number` methods can be found below:

```JavaScript
var number = 42
number.toFixed();
```

e.g:

```JavaScript
Math.PI

Math.sin(1.56)

Math.min(1,5,6,7)//returns 1
```
